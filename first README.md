# GeoGame: Interactive Map-Based Game

## **Aim**
The purpose of this project is to design a geo-game that combines geospatial technologies and frontend development. This interactive game allows users to identify locations on a map based on given hints, aiming to achieve the highest score.

## **Objectives**
### **1. Requirements**
The game must:
- Provide an interactive map where users can select locations.
- Include hints to help users guess locations correctly.
- Offer a scoring mechanism to track user performance.
- Feature multiple difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) to challenge users.
- Display a final score and time taken at the end of the game.

### **2. Layout of the Frontend**
The application will consist of the following screens:

1. **Welcome Screen**:
   - A simple interface introducing the game.
   - Navigation buttons to view the rules or start the game.

2. **Rules Screen**:
   - Explains how to play the game and the scoring system.
   - Includes a back button to return to the welcome screen.

3. **Mode Selection Screen**:
   - Allows users to choose a difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).

4. **Game Screen**:
   - Displays an interactive map and current score.
   - Provides hints for identifying the location.

5. **Result Screen**:
   - Shows the final score, time taken, and number of correct answers.

### **3. Frontend Layout Drawings**
Below are basic visual representations of the application layout:
